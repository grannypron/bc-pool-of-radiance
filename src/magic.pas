  element, burn melee attackers and leave it open to their own (C_EFFECT.FIRE_SHIELD_HOT, FIRE_SHIELD_COLD,
  FIRE_SHIELD_ZAP). Any key but H or C asks whether to abort the spell. }

  modifier and its Constitution's poison bonus) or is poisoned and killed, or takes 1d10 poison damage. A save leaves
  it "Unaffected". It runs where a stinking cloud's does: on the creatures inside when the cloud is laid, at each
  round's end and after each step. Magic resistance does not stop it, nor does it in Curse: the cloud is poison in the
  air, not a spell on the creature. }
